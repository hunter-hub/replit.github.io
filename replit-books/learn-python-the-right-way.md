# Learn Python the Right Way

[Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com) is our free introduction to Python. It is a book aimed at teaching university students programming, but it is suitable for all ages and for complete beginners.

For a more practical introduction, see [Code With Replit](./code-with-replit) - a practical, project-based book.

We recommend going through both books simultaneously to get a good mix of theory and practice.

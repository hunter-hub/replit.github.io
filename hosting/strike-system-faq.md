# Strike system FAQ 

Hey there! If you're on this page, that probably means you received a notification from one of our hard-working mods on Apps. 


### **Q: I got a warning. What is that about?** 

A: 🐝 A warning is a reminder to be a creative, constructive, and kind member of our Apps community. 

Mods will send you a warning when we feel that you have violated a part of the [Apps and Publishing Guidelines](https://docs.replit.com/repls/apps-and-publishing), which you agreed to way back when you published your first repl. 

In addition to giving you a warning, we took action in one of the following ways: 

* removed one of your tags on a repl,
* unpublished your repl,
* removed the cover image of one of your repls, AND/OR 
* removed one of your comments on Spotlight

### **Q: How does the strike system work?** 

A: ⚠️ If you receive **3+ warnings**, we may have to take action and temporarily ban your account from Apps. 

### **Q: My repl just got unpublished. Am I allowed to republish?** 

A: Yes, we encourage you to revise your repl so that it abides by the [Apps and Publishing Guidelines](https://docs.replit.com/repls/apps-and-publishing). After that, you may republish your repl. No hard feelings. 🤝

### **Q: I think there's been a mistake. Can I talk to someone about this decision?**

A: The mods are people and sometimes we make mistakes too. 🙋🏽‍♀️‍️ If you feel that this warning is unreasonable, contact us [here](https://contact.moderation.repl.co/).

### **Q: I just got banned. What now?**

A: You can still use Replit for personal use, but you won't be able to participate in the social features of Replit (Apps, comments on Spotlight pages, and ReplTalk). 😔

On a case-by-case basis, the mods team may consider unbanning certain users. If you feel that you are ready to rejoin the community and uphold the guidelines, we are open to discussing. Contact us [here](https://contact.moderation.repl.co/).

# Teams for Education

[Teams for Education](https://replit.com/teams-for-education) provides Replit users with key workflows specifically designed for students and teachers, over and above the core Replit features you may already know about. This article shows you how you (or, more likely, your school) can sign up and get started. Your school administrator or finance department may need to get involved. Once signed up, you can work with an unlimited number of students. 

## More About Teams

A team is a collection of teachers (who have admin privileges), and their students. The platform is based around projects, which are designed to provide a real-world experience to students. Each project can have multiple versions (often one for each student or group), so students can all start from the same point, but extend the base project in different ways depending on their instructions, skills, interests, etc.

## How to Sign Up

If you don't already have an account, sign up at [Replit](https://replit.com/). Now click on [Teams](https://repl.it/teams) in the sidebar on the left and select the "Education" plan.

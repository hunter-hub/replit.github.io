## Testing, assesments, and autograding

Since Repl.it is a general-purpose IDE that supports third-party packages in many languages, you can integrate testing frameworks into your projects which can be used for assesments. 

We've written a tutorial for how to do testing in Python using PyTest that you can read [here](https://docs.repl.it/tutorials/09-test-driven-development).

# Interviewing Candidates with Guest Mode

Replit offers a great platform for conducting technical interviews. The Teams Pro guest feature enables candidates to complete challenges under observation.

This tutorial will provide a step-by-step guide on how to conduct a technical interview using Teams Pro.

# Steps to follow:

We'll cover how to:

- Creat a repl
- Invite candidates
- Observe candidates

# Step 1 - Create a repl

To create an interview, you need to be in a team as an admin. You can check out the documentation [here](https://docs.replit.com/teams-pro/managing-teams) to find out how to create a team with replit.

Navigate to the 'Teams' page. Under the 'Team Repls' section click on the 'Create team repl' button and the following popup window will appear:

You can choose the template language you will be using for the interview and choose a suitable name, then click the 'Create Repl' button at the bottom. 

Once the repl has been created, you will be able to add the relevant files required for the interview. In this example, `main.py` has the instructions for the candidate to follow during the interview.

# Step 2 - Invite candidates

Once you have written your challenges, you can invite candidates by clicking on the invite button on the top-right corner on the window.

You can invite members who are already part of the team or external members by filling out their email address. You can also generate a join link for guests and then clicking the 'Invite' button.

Candidates will get a notification of the invite.

The candidate can join the repl by clicking on the notification of their invite; the invite email or via the join link. 

# Step 3 - Observe candidates

Once candidates join the interview, they will be able to access the challenges in the `main.py` file in read and write mode.

Interviewers are also able to observe the candidates as they complete the challenges.

By clicking on the round icon next to the invite button on the top-right corner, you will be able to observe the candidates screen and see as they work on their `main.py` file. The round icon, represents the candidate in the interview.

Candidates will also have the ability to observe your screen with the same steps mentioned above. This can allow them to see the changes you want to make or new intructions you want to add.

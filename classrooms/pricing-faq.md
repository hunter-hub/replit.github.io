# Classroom Pricing FAQ

This article contains frequently asked questions around the classroom product pricing,
including what constitutes a student, as well as how the pricing was determined.

## What constitutes a student seat?

Student counts are based on _total unique monthly active students_. That's a mouthful
so let me break it down:

* Total: it doesn't matter how many classrooms you have; we will tally up all the
number of students across all your classrooms.
* Unique: a student is counted once, it doesn't matter if they're in multiple
classrooms.
* Monthly active: an active student is a student that submits something that
given month.

In the subscription form, we ask you to enter the number of student seats you anticipate to use. If you go over for a given month, we give you a warning to allow you to adjust your subscription.

# How to create a lessson with replit

This tutorial will be a step-by-step guide on creating a lesson using replit's curriculum hub, where teachers could create assignments for their students.

This is a great tool because Replit allows teachers to create assignments for their students and also gives them the ability to observe or monitor students as they work. The students can also observe their students which can provide an ideal platform for monitoring students.

Check out the documentation at [Introduction to teams for education](https://docs.replit.com/teams/intro-teams-education) on how to create a team with replit. This is the platform that will allow us to create curriculums and invite students to find the lessons you create.


# Steps to follow:
We'll cover how to:
1. Create a new curriculum and project
1. Add lesson contents
1. Add lesson structure
1. Publish project

# Step 1 - Creating a new Curriculum

The terms 'lesson', 'project' or 'curriculum' are used frequently in the replit documentation. A curriculum can consist of lessons on different units or different assignments - which are projects -  that students can complete.

To add a new curriculum with replit, firstly, you need to make sure that you're the admin in your team. You can create a new curriculum from scratch or import one from the [curriculum hub](https://replit.com/curriculum) and alter it accordingly. In this tutorial however, we'll be creating a new tutorial from scratch.

If you navigate to your teams page, you should see the following below the team's name

Go ahead and click on the create project button circled in red.

Once that is done, you'll be prompted to select the template language you'll be working with and the name of your project. You can descibe the type of project you have created and this project can be an assignment students have to submit or a lesson with notes or both. If it's an assignment that you want the students to submit you can specify a due date for submission you can also specify which unit the project covers. Once you are done you can click the 'create' button at the bottom.

# Step 2 - Add lesson contents

Once you've created your project you'll be taken to a new window where you can add content for your lesson.

![add contents](/images/teamsForEducation/lesson-creation-images/add-contents.png)

In the files tab, the `main.py` file is where students can write submissions or complete different tasks. Any other files added in this section will be visible to the students so you can also place additional notes in this section.

The section labelled 'Lesson' will consist of all files accesible by the teachers or team admins. However, an instructions.md file can be included which will be available to the students in a read only format.

# 3 - Step 3 Add lesson structure

 By clicking 'Add Lesson contents',  replit will generate an assets folder where you can put resources such as images to use in markdown files, as well as the instructions.md file previously mentioned and a lessonplan.md file.

 The lesson plan will only be accessible to the teachers and here, you can structure the lesson by specifying lesson objectives or writing out solutions as well.

 # Step 4 - Publish project

 Once all files have been setup, you can publish the project to make it available to students by clicking on the 'publish' button on the top right section of the window.
 On the next pop up, make sure the slider is moved to the right and turned blue to ensure it's visibility to the students and then click save.

## Creating projects and assignments

Teams for Education include both Team Projects and Team Repls. 

* **Team Projects** are visible and editable only by the teacher and each individual student or student group. These are great for assignments and group projects in which each student/group needs to work independently. 

* **Team Repls** are visible and editable to everyone on the Team. These are great for collaborative coding exercises such as pair programming challenges and code-alongs. 

## Creating Team Projects
From your team dashboard, create a new project.

**Select project language, title, description, due date, and whether this will be a group project.** You'll be redirected to the IDE to add any comments, tests, and initial coding blocks you'd like your students to start from. You'll assign groups when you publish the project.

### Publishing

When you are done editing your project and it is ready to be published, click "Publish project" from the IDE.

A modal appears, where you can toggle the project between "Published" and "Unpublished".

**For individual projects**, students are able to fork the project and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and team admins can see and edit their work.

**For group projects**, you can assign students into submission groups to collaborate. Click "Auto Assign" to automatically assign all students into equal groups or assign each group manually. You can add and remove new groups, drag and drop students between groups, and search for students. Groups cannot be removed after saving, but students may be reassigned into different groups later.

Click "Save" to finalize any changes, or "Cancel" to discard changes.

## Submitting Student Work 

When students have completed their work on the project, they click "Submit" in the IDE header, which will notify all teachers of their submission. Students may continue working on projects and resubmit them after hitting "Submit."
